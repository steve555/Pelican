    <p>A proactive, tenacious, caring individual, I have always have an interest in technology and computing. I have worked for IT agencies on various contracts mainly around the midlands area. With my current role as a Amazon Associate, some months ago, I was introduced to the 
AWS Re:Start Programme that is being ran by an organisation called Generations. 
There was a high demand from applicants to join the course and I was thrilled to had successfully enrolled onto it.  </p>
<p>I have studied IT related qualifications, such as  COMPTIA A+, CLAIT and REVIT 2019 Architecture Associate, in which I have  invested in for my future.
I have also  learned new skills both during my contracts and learning Linux at home,
The Re:Start programme has expanded my knowledge of Linux commands  and taught me new skills such as Python programming,  setting up and running databases, and learning about security concepts. </p>
<p>I would be an excellent choice for AWS, I have a customer-centric mindset in approaching and solving problems for the customer.
One example is when I was on a major contract through a company called RSP. They were part of a number of contractors for a major roll out project for the bank RBS. At the  RBS Birmingham branch, one of their staff was missing a program after her computer was upgraded.
So I logged into her machine using my credentials and pulled the program that she needed from the central server and installed it onto her machine.
 My tenaciousness and care for what the problem the customer is facing, will be representing the very high standards that AWS is always upholding.</p>
<p>I have always have a yearning to learn new things. In having passing my AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam,  The role in AWS will give me very good grounding with hands on experience in demonstrating my newly attained skills from the AWS Cloud Practitioner course run by Generations, and this will give me good grounding in preparation for the AWS Sysops Exam.I want to specialise in Administration. </p>
